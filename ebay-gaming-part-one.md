Some time ago, very early on in my so-called 'gaming career' I discovered that thing called eBay. 'Ah,' I thought, running my fingers through my thick , unkempt hair [nb:[^1]], 'This eBay thing could be used to purchase a myriad of cheap games. Also, I have no where else to buy them.'

So that is what I did. My interests at that time lay mainly in war games, having not discovered the subtle joy of taking two small pieces of brown wood and swapping them for a small piece of blue wood. So I purchased a number of war games that had one defining quality, **cheapness**. Or to put it another way:

> Somebody wanted to sell it because they didn't like it, and not many other people wanted to buy it because it wasn't any good.

Hence I ended up with a strange assortment of games ranging from Battle of the Bulge (1965), to Football Strategy (1959), to Balkan Storm (1995). They arrived, intermittently, packaged in everything from padded pouches to reconstructed cereal boxes. I would unpack each one, inspect the usually, depressingly, achingly dull contents,
browse the 8 point font rule book, and then put them on my shelf in historical order. I never played any of them.

This was, to say the least, a horridly inefficient use of my scarce resources. If I was a country I'd be North Korea (at least then I'd have better hair). In order to rectify this I decided to attempt to play as many of these as I could, recording the outcomes in a variously entertaining/trite/undergraduate humour style play reports.

There were a few impediments to this plan:

- I had no one else to play with.
- I am universally hopeless at any sort of strategic game.
- I am a poor rules reader.
- I have a short attention span

Lastly, I did not genuinely want to play most of them. This is all heightened by the fact I am playing them in my Redback Spider infested garage, where every brush of wind on my legs made me think I was about to die.

This was a few years ago â€“ I originally posted these to Boardgame Geek. I have fixed some of the grammar, included a few pictures, and generally tightened up the heady narrative.

First up, The Crusades, a 1978 cardboard purgatory with a thing about verisimilitude...

[^1]: This is a lie. I had, and still have, no hair. There will be other lies throughout this series, but that is the only one I'm giving you for free.
