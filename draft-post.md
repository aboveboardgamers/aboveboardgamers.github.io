This week, __Firepower__. A tactical squad level hex and counter game, which for the uninitiated means little cardboard counters on a map covered with numbered hexes. The maps show hills and bushes, farmhouses and creeks, jungles, and all manner of diverting scenery. In comparison to game boards from our previous trysts, this looks like it was designed by the love child of Ru Paul and the drummer from Kiss. Even the charts have colour! Lord bless me.

Anyway, the premise of Firepower seems to be to recreate almost any skirmish of the modern era (circa 1984), from WW2 to Vietnam and the wars in the Middle East. Each chit represents one soldier or one vehicle. You can name them, give them a back story, even pause to write letters home if you wish. There is also a dizzying array of weapons, tanks, trucks, and flamethrowers to choose from, each with over 20 statistics to deal with. If the Chartered Accountants Association ever declared war this is what it would look like.

As far as I can tell, you can line up a bunch of guys with WW2 Tommy Guns and let them loose at another bunch of guys with M60s, tanks, flamethrowers, and bazookas. Let at 'em indeed! Having no clue about weapons I decided to play the basic game that has only generic “Rifles”, “Machine Guns”, and “Pistols”. However, in keeping with the theme of “What if” in the game, I decided to pit two of history's greatest armies against each other.

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare yourself for __The Imbroglio in Dubbo__, where a squad of English Public School Boys (Sebastian, Tristian, Basil, Monty, and Quentin) fight for their lives against a Rig (the correct collective noun) of Australian Tradies (Bruce, Mungo, Chook, Bazza and Sluggo).

Firepower does not just have players taking turns one after another. It uses an impulse system where you draw chits to see who will move, so it's a bit random, and one side can get several goes in a row, which is quite good. The Tradies drew first, and the whole rig of them ran headlong at the Boys at the other end of the map. Mungo, nervously stroking his LMG (light machine gun), and Bruce went straight up the nearby hill, giving them a bonza view of the battlefield. The rest grabbed an Esky and wandered north to try to set up a flanking manoeuvre. On the other side, Quentin and Monty hung back as reserves while the rest dug into a strong central position and waited for the first rifle shot.

On turn two, tired of waiting for that first shot, Sebastian and Tristram moved along under the cover of a small hill but Mungo spotted Sebastian through a narrow gap and let fly at him with a quick burst. Oh, the blood! The Tradies cracked a tinnie at their success as they realised the LMG was one hell of a weapon. Basil, labouring under the load of his own LMG, moved slowly around the largest hill as he worried that every man and his dog was now trying to kill him when, as far as he was concerned, he was meant to be on a working holiday in Australia. Chook and the lads ran their ragged arses at the hill where Basil was quivering and began to fan out. Basil was not to be outdone though and made it round the hill with enough time to crouch down and then wet himself in fear (using up 1 movement point in doing so). Bazza and Chook made it to the first slope of the hill, while Sluggo and Jocko paused to take a couple of pot shots at Quentin. Being crouched, wet and in the rough, Quentin thought himself safe. He was, the shots flew wide and high - this didn't stop the Tradies from opening another tinnie though, just in case it was their last one.

It wasn't their last one (a lucky draw saw them move again), so they loaded up and tried again. They missed, but that next tinnie tasted good. Quentin decided enough was enough. He let fly at the now slightly “piston and broke” Tradies. Sluggo cashed in his chips, and in tribute, his mates cracked a tinnie.

Bazza and Chook, enraged, turned the corner of the hill and lined Quentin up in their sights. Trying for accuracy, they turned off the semi-automatic function and steadied their nerves with another tinnie. A rifle crack rang out across the valley, followed by a small whimper of _“Mummykins!”_ as Quentin bought the farm. The Tradies got their third turn in a row, so Bazza and Chook headed for safety on the down slopes of the hill.

On the left, Sebastian and Tristram, who had been distracted by an argument over who was the best coxless four at Oxford, got back into the action. Sebastian topped a hill on the east slope that gave him a clear line of sight at Mungo. On the west slope Tristram did the same, but further back and unable to really see much. Sebastian fired, and on his second shot put one straight through Mungo. “Hip hip old chap” yelled Tristram.

Monty and Basil decided the time was finally right to make a move and promptly went to hide amongst some trees. Bazza and Chook spotted Monty and moved slowly around the base of the hill in order to surprise the Boys. Too slowly, it turned out, for Tristam (having had a quick sherry) sprinted down the hill and let fly at a very surprised Jocko. He missed, but it was a fine moment for British manhood. Bazza and Chook finally got close enough to Monty to take a crack at him, and despite the fact that he was lying prone under a tree, Monty was made to be a bit more prone---and a lot more dead. Jock turned his rifle at Tristram, who had been so busy running down the hill he forgot to duck and was now basically standing upright in the middle of a field. It was a predictable end. The Tradies got the next impulse as well and all ran to hide, as they knew it was getting close to tea, and the Public Boys would soon be off.

___And so it was. Turn four came to an end, and that was it for the basic game.___

Was it any good? Well, I think there might be tad too much interest in gun stats for my liking, but it was surprisingly simple to play and really quite fun. The one person chit encourages you to add a narrative to the action. The main game even has a character sheet which would make it even better, you could follow Bazza and Chook on their pub crawl of death from map to map. The impulse system is good, giving you a good chance at taking some calculated risks. Where some might call it random t prevented the common ‘make sure everyone is safe’ mindset. It was possible you could leave some troops exposed if you thought there was a chance you’d get a second turn.

Of all the games so far this was the best. Mind you, that’s a low bar.

Plus it has coloured charts!
