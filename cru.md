The Crusades, by Richard Berg, was published in 1978 by SPI. In his former life Mr. Berg designed fonts for the legal industry, perfecting in 1972, a font so small it could only be read via an Electron Scanning Microscope. This is the font used on the counters of The Crusades. After set-up---and a short stint in hospital for corrective eye surgery---I was ready to play the shorter scenario.

This scenario is of the Third Crusade (the pop-culture poster-child of the Crusades), and features Saladin, Richard the Lionheart, Bohemond, and Guy! They fight over land so ancient it first appeared as a joke at a Johnny Farnham concert! How could it get any better!

The first thing I noticed after set up, was that the Crusaders liked to clump together (Acre was in high tourist season to say the least) with a virtual army of Christian knights lining up to run at the walls. Lining up is the exact wrong word: they precariously balance, and then topple over at the slightest whim. _Those with neatness issues have fair warning of a trigger here_.

Acra was surrounded by our God-directed brave knights, but the army of the even braver Saladin was waiting just around the corner, so the good knights got the updated word from God to run away to Jaffa. A far less dangerous place to siege, victory at Jaffa could open up a path to Jerusalem, and the True Cross (a religious artefact, not a coffee bar). Saladin, meanwhile, marched to Acre to help out his general Kara-Kush, probably disappointed to find no Crusaders there. Also meanwhile, al-Mansur and az-Zahir (also not coffee bars), headed off to try and surround the quite hairy Bohemond in Antioch.

The siege of Jaffa was a non-event, and the city fell to the Crusaders with little resistance. _Mild prayer, and vigorous pillaging, signaled the end of an otherwise uneventful __turn one___.

Turn two began with a random event for the Saracens (an event is drawn each turn after the first, perhaps putting a spanner in the works of those who plan carefully, but being fairly meaningless for me). It was an attempt to assassinate Geoffrey of Donjon at Castle Krak. It failed, and Geoffrey looked out from the Castle Krak and thought, 'What the f*%k was that!'.

Somewhere else, I'm guessing Constantinople, more Crusaders, including King Richard, were waiting to board boats and head for the Holy Land. However, a squabble broke out amongst Richard's men as they boarded (something to do with who got the top bunks) the end result being only about half of them could fit in. They set sail, cocktails at the ready, for al-Marqab.

At Antioch, Mansur and Zahir stormed the walls in search of Bohemond, and would have found him if he hadn't already run away to join Richard to compare beard lengths. Down south, Henri de Champagne stayed back in Jaffa with a small guard force, while Otto moved to the otherwise irrelevant Arsuf---an even smaller force in tow---with the idea of retiring for good.

Saladin picked up a few of Kush's men and marched towards Nablus, hoping to catch the Crusaders at Jerusalem. He suffered horribly on the march, losing a good part of his force. Phillip of France moved out from Tyre, and slowly headed for Castle Beaufort. The Egyptian fleet moved to Jaffa and the Crusader fleet to Tripoli. 

The end of May came with turn three, and its sweet shower rained only from one side. The Saracen's rolled another assassination attempt and tried for Geoffrey again. Showing great wisdom or perhaps cowardice, he survived this second attempt. Later, from atop a parapet of Castle Krak, Geoffrey of Donjon was overheard muttering, _'This is a really shitty neighbourhood'_.

In the south, Crusaders saw Saladin's dust in the distance but trusted they could avoid him. They couldn't, and the two armies faced each other in battle. Up north, Phillip took Beaufort while Richard headed down with his fleet to Tyre. The Egyptians blockaded Tripoli and the some other minor marches took place but all eyes were on the now named “Battle of the Jerusalem Plain”.

The Crusaders had an army strength of 66 (the brother of the beast!) while Saladin had 64, and was the designated attacker. King Guy, being naturally hotheaded, impetuously decided to charge. The imp! Saladin coolly formed up to outflank them, and it became clear that the Crusaders were in serious trouble. A quarter of the Knights fell on the field of battle. Some because of loose fitting heels, but most because of loosely attached heads, the Crusaders were forced to retreat to Jaffa.

> King Guy, being naturally hotheaded, impetuously decided to charge.  

Turn four, the turn of truth! Disaster again for the Crusaders. No more assassination attempts on Geoffrey of Krak. No, this time Phillip of France decides to go home! That sounds most stereotypical. Meanwhile, Saracen reinforcements arrive, having not argued about sleeping arrangements. Much joy for all in Damascus. Other than that, not much happened. The Crusaders (with King Guy) laid siege to Ascalon, and Richard moved north to make up for the now missing King of France.

Turn five looked grim. While Richard laid siege to Balbek, and Guy continued to bang his sword against the walls of Ascalon, Saladin simply rolled up to the gates of Arsuf and took it as if at a whim. Otto's retirement was now permanent. Imad takes Jerusalem. Just like that. Who'd have thought? With some persistence, Guy takes Ascalon, but Richard finds Balbek a tougher nut to crack. Being a King doesn't make you all that.

> Otto's retirement was now permanent.

The Crusaders are somewhat stuck. Their forces are split between north and south, with Guy's army at Ascalon looking in great trouble. He makes a break for it, and heads inland and northwards to escape the dastardly Saracens. Henry abandons Jaffa and also heads north, hoping to make it, but prepared to put up a defence if needed to protect the others. The two Arab armies now dominate the south. In the center, the remnants of the French army moved to take on Acre, also hoping to keep the Saracens busy for a while. It works, leaving poor old Kara-Kush alone in his city. However, Richard still can't take Balbek. What a tool.

Chaos ensues, with many a plan abandoned due to that fact the person in charge probably forgot what he was doing. Everyone turns up in Haifs, where Saladin had to stop due to Henry de Champagne's brave defence, with the bulk of the Crusaders then moving south to meet the expected Saracen attack. **Into the jaws of death!** With Aziz of Cairo joining in it resulted in a 101- 81 army match-up in favour of Saladin. Party in the kitchen or what?

The game uses ratios as part of the combat tables, and in the end it turned into a ratio of 1:1 so it was all about even. Another thing the game does in combat is that each player can choose their own battle tactic. This wouldn't make sense for me so I did it randomly---regardless of sense. Guy impetuously charges while Saladin, perhaps sensing a change in the air, or perhaps now noting the hole in his pantaloons, decides to perform an orderly withdrawal. His troops cry out in despair but he sticks to his guns. Unsurprisingly, it doesn't work and he loses 20% of his men in one swoop. In the mean time, Izzy of Cairo attacks an unsuspecting Richard, and boots him all the way to Tripoli. Bloodied but unbowed, (though still a little bit cardboardy) Saladin saw himself as in the lead.

> Saladin, perhaps sensing a change in the air, or perhaps now noting the hole in his pantaloons, decides to perform an orderly withdrawal.

In the next turn, the Crusaders finally took Acre, but my now good mate Kara had already taken off to Beirut, where he'd heard the coffee was to die for. Richard got besieged himself (what a tool), while Bohemend of Antioch bravely rode out of his castle to take on a Muslim army he'd spotted heading south. As always, he decided the best option was to again impetuously charge. He gets wiped out, and not in a good way. Guy moves down to besiege Saladin to little effect. But it gave him something to do.

The next turn is momentous! The siege of Saladin continues but it obviously bores the great Muslim general so he (what a guy!) decides to come out and fight while Guy (what a guy!) looks forward to directing what must be another bloodbath. It was. Saladin defends in place (he had to defend some place) while the Crusaders, who appear to have a one track mind, impetuously attack. The result is that Saladin loses another 40% of his men and loses the city. He is in serious trouble. So much trouble, that with at least another year of fighting ahead of him, and no chance of reinforcements, he decides to surrender. Palestine remains in Christian hands and the course of history changes. Not sure if for the better.

_**And all from my garage**. Amazing!_

So that was the first game. I have never brought it out again because it took me about 3 hours to play, and that was by myself, and I wasn't really paying much attention, and only had scant regard for the more complicated rules. Add in another player and the promised 6 hour play time seems a little on the conservative side. But would I ever play it again? Possibly. I liked the details, the obvious research, the way armies could just march past each other with careless oblivion in the Palestinian dust, and the combat was rather cool (that Mr. Berg knows his way around a combat results table). But the lines of communication look tedious to say the least (I ignored most of them), and the stacking of counters was maddeningly persistent. They were always falling over, like wingers at a Mad Monday do. Still, for an oldie it was pretty good.
