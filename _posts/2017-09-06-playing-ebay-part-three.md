When I was a young 'un, I played Rugby League for my school. My school had a crap team (my presence no doubt accelerated the crappiness) and we were regularly beaten by the sorts of scores often achieved after a full day of cricket. After one particularly lamentable first half performance our coach, a mustachioed villain from the Balkans, gathered us around him on the sideline.

“After you kick off in the next half, I want you all to lie down on the field,” he said.

“Why Sir?” replied our captain.

“Because at least that way there's a chance one of the bastards will trip over you,” he roared. And with that, he strode off. We never saw him again.[^1]

Now the thing about this type of Rugby League is that, like many contact sports, it really sucks at times. Especially if you are no good. Walking out onto the field facing people twice your size knowing that for the next 80 minutes they'll be using your head as a mini-trampoline, induced at times, a near zombie-like feeling of despair. None of us really knew why we carried on.

However, as my stepfather always said - *“What doesn't kill you makes you stronger”* - so on we went. Mind you, he also said *“The only reason you come off the field is to empty the blood from your boots, then you go back on again”*, so he may not have been the wisest source of information. Or even sane.

It was with a very similar feeling that I faced up to Football Strategy: a no holds barred board game exercise in the breakneck sport of NFL.

It was published in 1959, making it older than me. If anything it wore its age even worse. The board is a green field, no surprise there, with a little plastic football marking the spot where the ball is to be played from. There are two sets of cards, one for defence and one for offence. Other than the rule book and charts, that's it. No players, no quarterback, no refs, no nothing. Theme here was clearly not the end point.

And the rule book itself was no beauty. A mere four short pages with no pretty pictures, it could have been even shorter. This is because the entire game can be summed up thus: Player A and B pick a number each. They then cross reference those numbers on a chart and do what it says. Since what the chart says is to move the little football back or forth a fairly small number of steps the tension was hardly a threat to anyone's heart or blood pressure.

The rule book says that it is an excellent solitaire game, and so it is, as I imagine that it is as much fun as with one as it would be with two, or for that matter four.

The solitaire game run likes this. The offence (me) chooses a play by selecting a card. I only have 10 to choose from so it isn't exactly a strain. My favourite is the flair pass, though I have no idea what it is and the game makes no attempt to instruct me on this matter. The defence (also me) then turns over a random defence card, and we both (still me) consult the table and move the little football up and down the little football field. I then jot down how many seconds that took (never enough in my opinion) and do it again. It is as much like work as any game could possibly get. Eventually a team scores but I can't bring myself to care which one. After 10 minutes I had blown through a whole half, the score was 14 – 7 but, as with my school football coach, I simply had to walk away.

There is, however, one reason to buy this game. It comes with a little booklet called “Football Widow's Handbook” that is a sheer delight to read. Written by a man who grew up in the fifties, and for whom the sixties never happened, it purports to educate the wife about football so that she can enjoy watching it her hubby. Why she was allowed out of the kitchen in the first place I'll never know, but there you go. It is full of bon-mots such as:

*' . . . mention to your husband that “there must be a conspiracy afoot between the Referee and the Color Men.” Such female-like rationale keeps you in your place, yet serves to indicate to your husband that you're really trying to understand the game – desperately.'*

I don't quite know what it means. Why would the ref conspire with the colour men, and who are the colour men to begin with? And what type of behaviour might indicate that it was the correct time to bring up that little conversation starter? Do refs in all sports conspire with the colour men or is it an NFL thing? Has the NFL been plagued with such conspiracies? What has been the result? Were the colour men responsible for JFK and the refs for faking the moon landings?

*Why did I purchase such a determinedly dud of a game?* I remembered at uni buying this ***type*** of game with my flatmate. It was big, the rule book dense and obtuse, and was a complicated puzzle type of thing that seemed to involve dense stacks of information about famous college teams from decades past and no actual game play. It was an impenetrable mess. So I bought it for the nostalgia of buying what I thought was the very same game.

It wasn't. But it was just as bad.
