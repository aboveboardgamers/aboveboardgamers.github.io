The second free Wednesday game night is happening this Wednesday (23 August) down at the Pipe Band Hall in Victoria Park, Dubbo from 6 pm.

As usual, a huge array of games will be available to play (or you can bring your own) and someone will be on hand to teach you how to play. We've added some racing games as well as a few easy to learn card games---you're sure to find something to pique your interest.

__It's free. It's fun. It's for the whole family.__ Take part in the fastest-growing hobby in the world and meet new people.

See you all there!
