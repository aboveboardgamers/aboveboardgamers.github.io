_“The most demoralising and destructive thing that could happen to any soldier in the trenches was to be strafed by enemy aircraft.”_ So says the introduction to the trench-strafing mission in Richthofen's War (published in 1972). I could think of a few worse things: being told to leave the trench and walk slowly towards the enemy is one, and getting executed for shooting and eating a delicious plump-breasted pigeon called Speckly Jim is another. However, I guess that getting shot at from the sky would have been quite a downer, and so it was this scenario I chose to play out for this installment.

This is yet another hex and counter game. The scale is quite small, each counter represents a single plane. Each hex just 100 metres or so. The game comes with a good mounted board, in three parts, with a semi-realistic aerial photograph. What also greeted me was a surprising number of counters representing a couple of dozen WW1 planes, each with a little tiny line drawing of the machine itself. Its almost like you're there.

With this project doing nothing else if not increasing my rules reading ability. I was able to blow through the fold-out pamphlet style instructions with ease. As a rules-set, they're actually really good – and anyone who's played other air games such as [Wings of War: Famous Aces](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9203/wings-war-famous-aces) will pick this up really easy.

I chose, as the British, a SPAD 13 (without realising it was French!) and a Sopwith Camel, which turned out to be quicker and more manoeuvrable than any other plane in this part of the sky. The Germans chose an Albatros D-II (don't the Krauts read literature?) and a Fokker Dr. 1 that could turn on a sixpence but was, according to the rules, “tricky to fly”. I tried turning both counters in circles a few times but couldn't see any difference, so I guess that must have been a typo. There is a little form to fill out your plane's abilities, as well as its damage and so, it seems 'old-fashioned' but is actually quite simple. A game turn involves activating a plane, noting its speed and moving that many hexes, turning, climbing, diving, and shooting as you can see fit or are allowed. Each aircraft is different: some can turn right very easily but not left, some can dive, and some can climb. The performance of each craft is historically derived (I suppose – I have no actual clue) and it all works out very nicely.

The British mission was to strafe the German trenches. They would get 1 point for every trench hex they hit, while the Germans had the sole job of shooting the British out of the sky, getting 15 points for doing so. Thus did the planes line up on opposite sides of the map. The British opened the throttle and shot off towards the western edge, before separating with the SPAD heading south – or south-ish.

The Germans stuck with the Camel, guessing that was the plane that would do the most damage. The Camel had to slow down quite a bit to be able to dive down to strafing level (which also gave the pilot the opportunity to wave at admiring onlookers) which afforded the Fokker time to get behind him. It didn't really matter though, as the Camel accelerated quickly and took out 6 trench hexes with ease while the Fokker shot at, and missed its rapidly disappearing tail. The Albatross also got a shot off and managed to inflict 1 hit on the Camel, of absolutely no consequence. Any ordinary pilot would have increased speed again and continued strafing, but the guy in the Camel was no ordinary pilot. He figured he'd done his bit for Blighty, and suddenly turned and took off into the sun, getting off the map before anyone had realised what was happening. The reason for this was poor planning by its elderly controller, it was going so fast it couldn't turn. I'm not sure it was part of the battle plan.

The poor old fellow in the SPAD, his pants turning rapidly brown, decided to take one strafing run (what fun!) and then try to escape, ensuring an easy points victory for the British. Well, he got his strafing run in (another 6 points) but the Germans were all over him like lipstick on a cheap pig, shattering his elevator cables, meaning he was going to fly low and level the rest of the game. He didn't have to worry about that much though, as the next attack by the Albatross (I knew it would be bad luck for someone) blew him out of the sky.

By far the best game so far, and from my fading memory also one of the first I picked up. Great details in the rules, easy to pick up, and quick to play. This one moves to the top of the list in terms of “might play again”, though I've got a good few more other games to get through first, including [Rommel in North Africa: The War in the Desert 1941-42](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/11113/rommel-north-africa-war-desert-1941-42), which will be up next.

It is also now, though I may be in danger of repeating myself, that I can see the magnificent narrative possibilities of these games. Yes, there are puzzles to solve, odds to calculate, risks to take, and rules, rules and more rules to read. But at the heart of all these games is a deep desire (I think) to create a shared narrative with a good friend. Gather round a bit of coloured cardboard littered with small squares of cardboard and take part in perhaps the oldest human ritual of all, that of the storyteller. Not a bad way to spend the odd hour or two if I do say so myself.
