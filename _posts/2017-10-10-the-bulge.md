General Anthony McAuliffe stares out at you from the rules book, looking for all the world as if Mr. Cleaver has become the Army's top brass. No doubt all his kids, and even the irascible Eddie Haskill, called him “Sir” until the day he died. This is, proudly, an old-fashioned board game. As were most of those pop culture references.

In celebration of playing Battle of the Bulge (1965), I queued up the movie of the same name (1966), played and watched, intermittently, through the night.

Both were fantastic. The movie, because there is nothing better than an old war movie to take you back to a simpler, more innocent time, and the game, because it was really fun and forced me to make decisions I didn't think I'd have to make.

The map is mounted, which is cool and a little bit unusual for this time period, and has some pretty cool decorations for hills, rivers, roads, and forests. The counters (it is another hex and counter game) are easy to read, with only a few numbers to show the attack and speed of each unit. The basics are that the Germans start with a whole shebang load of troops on the east edge of the board, and must get them to, and keep them at, the far western edge of the board - over the River Meuse - by the end of the game. If that was all, it would be easy, because there are more Germans here than in a Sydney backpackers---but there is a kicker: the Germans must trace a free path, along roads, from each unit to the eastern edge of the board, or those units will eventually die. A free path cannot pass through American ZOCs (zones of control) which means the Yanks just have to control a few towns in the centre of the board and the Germans will self-destruct.

In the movie, this was represented by the German thirst for fuel (a historical fact), where the Panzer commander spent most of his time searching for more gas to get his tanks working (a historical fiction). In the end, his entire column of the finest tanks in WW2 was defeated by some gimped up Americans rolling burning barrels of oil at him. __Who'd have thought!__ But I digress.

The opening turns see the Germans run west at a fast pace, leaving behind a smallish contingent of leather-panted bovver boys to deal with a few Americans caught hanging out in the south-east. Pretty soon though, things turned sour. The Germans just could not destroy the Americans and were forced to send their fresh troops into that battle rather than send them forward to control the centre. It is here, in my humble opinion, that the game is really clever. To actually defeat an enemy, you've got to have overwhelming odds. If you don't (and 2:1 is not overwhelming enough), you are more likely than not to be what is called 'Engaged”. This means you cannot move but must continue to fight into the next round. So unless the Germans poured troops into the battles, they stalled. Add to this the fact that troops in towns have their defence doubled, and the attacking side has to have well over four times the attack to make any headway. Brutal – but fantastic. The Germans just had to keep sending fresh meat in to get rid of a few pesky Yanks, while the other plucky Yanks dug into hills and towns in the centre of the map. __It was going to get ugly__.

Meanwhile, on the small screen, it turns out the American hero is a plump, black marketeering buffoon with a piece on the side (a dame, not a weapon). His tank takes a direct hit to the turret that blows it in half, but he suffers nary a scratch while his crewmate (the only other one we see) has an indeterminate ailment that makes him want to lie back in the sun like Greta Garbo for the rest of the movie. The German commander is humiliated by having to take his orders from a guy who looks like Sgt Shultz but dresses like Col. Klink, which must be tough for any Prussian nutcase.

It took, in the game, until the end of day three to get rid of the Americans in the south-east, and there were precious few Germans west of the Meuse. In the following turns, the Germans had better luck, killing off a host of Americans and taking full control of the centre---from Bastogne to Marche to Andenne and Huy. But then the American reinforcements arrived, not in the centre, but to the east, figuring they could just as easily cut off supplies from there. By the end of December 22nd, the Germans were one confused bunch. It only got worse. At the end of the next day, the Americans had built fortifications at Clervaux and St Vith, making them almost impregnable. Other American forces performed as proto-guerillas, hiding in the hills and harassing the Germans at will. This stopped the full weight of German arms from descending upon the fortified towns, restoring supply to those troops further forward. On December 25th the Germans west of the Meuse received the dubious Chrissy present of starving to death and being removed from the board.

_By the 28th it was hopeless_. Americans dotted the board like flies on a shit sandwich, and the Germans were tying themselves in knots trying to keep troops west of the Meuse and keep supply lines open. It was a task beyond them, though they did not suffer the ultimate kick in the backside of the above mentioned rolling barrels of death. On the afternoon of the 28th, the Germans surrendered. In the movie, the tanks crews got out of their tanks and walked back to Germany while the Americans looked on – which I found odd – but then it was, at times, a very odd movie. In the game, the Germans were rounded up and placed in a small plastic bag. I'm not sure who got the worse deal.
