The first event of the Above Board Gamers is happening this **Wednesday 9th August**. Come down and experience games of mirth and mayhem; of skill, and just a little luck!

There are some easy introductory games, as well as more meaty games for those who desire more complexity. Whether you want to work together to beat the game, or use the game to beat your friends, we have something for you.

+ **Splendor** – build a gem trading empire.
+ **Colt Express** –  a spaghetti western in cardboard.
+ **27th Passenger** – keep yourself alive whilst all around you die.
+ **CV** – roll dice to get a job, or a baby, or a car; your choice.
+ **Agricola Family** – farming in the middle ages, a natural gaming topic.
+ **Bisikle** – finger flicking bike racing.
+ **Betrayal** on the House on the Hill – an old fashioned horror flick brought to life.
+ **Castle Panic** – work together to keep your castle intact against a horde of unlikely monsters.
+ **Lanterns** – Japanese pattern building for the whole family.
+ **Sushi Go** – compete against others to create the perfect sushi menu.
+ **DC Deck Builder** – use the superheroes from the DC universe to save the world.
+ **Revolution** – with guile and deception, become ruler of the city.
+ **Bang the Dice Game** – I shot the sheriff (and several of the deputies).
+ **Kingdom Builder** – expand your kingdom faster than your foes.
+ **Pandemic Cuthulu** – work together to save the world from ungodly gods.
+ **Mission Red Planet** – colonise Mars whilst not getting left at the launch pad.

As always, someone will be there to guide you through the rules.
